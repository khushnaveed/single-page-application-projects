# Movie List
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Create a movie list by populating movies on the page.

**Instructions**:

-  Import and export the classes as needed.
-  Work from the `index.js` file.
-  Resolve the promise from the `Client.js` file. Once this is resolved, display the data on the page. Note: you do not need to change any code from the `View.js` or the `Client.js`. You only need to add a token from the API to the `Client.js` file.
-  A movie should only be displayed once. If a user inputs a movie twice, display an alert.
-  The user should be able to save their movie list so that when the page is refreshed, their movie list will still be displayed.
-  The user should be able to reset the page - this means that the movie list should be removed entirely from the page and nothing should appear if the page is refreshed.

-  Important: use the following API for this exercise: https://www.omdbapi.com/
