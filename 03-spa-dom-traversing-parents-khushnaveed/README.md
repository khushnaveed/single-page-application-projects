# DOM traversal from child to parent
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


In this assignment, you will learn how to traverse the Document Object Model (DOM) by listing all the parent elements of a specific element in HTML.

## Tasks

- The [HTML](./index.html) has already been prepared for you. Do not edit this file.
- Complete the tasks below by writing your JavaScript code in the [script.js](./script.js) file

### Task 1 - Retrieve the 'Cite' Element

- Retrieve the `<cite>` element from the HTML document using the `querySelector()` method
- Store it in a variable `currentElement`

### Task 2 - Traverse and Create Parent List

- Create the variable `parentList`, and initialize it as an empty array
- Create a loop that;
  - retrieves the node name from the `currentElement`
  - converts it to lower case
  - adds it to the **beginning** of the `parentList` array
  - sets the `currentElement` variable to the `parentElement` property of the current `currentElement`
  - continues looping until no more `parentElement` properties are found

### Task 3 - Print the Parent Element List

- Join all elements of the `parentList` array into a single string with ' > ' as the separator
- Print this string to the `console`

**Example**

`html > body > main > section > blockquote > footer > cite`

## Bonus Task

Can you modify your solution to also include the classes each parent element has, where applicable? For example, the output might look like: `section.page > blockquote`.
